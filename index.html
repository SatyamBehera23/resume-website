        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Major Project-II: SalesSavvyAI [Jan, 2025 - Apr, 2025]
                <p>As part of the 8th Semester Major Project-II titled "SalesSavvyAI", I contributed to both the front-end and database development of the platform. On the front-end, I customized the HTML5UP Escape Velocity template to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface using semantic HTML and CSS. For the backend, I worked with Prisma SQL to design and implement efficient database queries for managing customer and sales data. I was responsible for structuring the database schema, optimizing queries, and integrating the database with the Flask-based API to enable seamless data retrieval and manipulation. My contributions ensured a smooth user experience, robust data management, and efficient interaction between the UI and the database.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Major Project-I: SaaS-Based Dashboard Application [Aug, 2024 - Nov, 2024]
                <p>As part of the 7th Semester Major Project-I titled 'SaaS-Based Dashboard Application', I contributed to both the front-end development and UI structuring of the platform. I collaborated with my team to build a responsive and visually engaging dashboard interface, customizing HTML5 and CSS components to align with modern design principles. I implemented dynamic UI elements such as navigation sidebars, summary cards, and interactive charts to simulate real-time data analytics. My responsibilities included designing responsive layouts, ensuring cross-device compatibility, and enhancing user experience through clean, semantic HTML and modular CSS. My contributions helped deliver a polished, professional front-end that effectively showcased the capabilities of a data-driven SaaS platform.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Minor Project: Plant Disease Detection System [Jan, 2024 - Apr, 2024]
                <p>The Plant Disease Detection System is a machine learning–based web application developed to accurately identify diseases in plant leaves using image classification. Built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow and deployed via a Streamlit interface, the system allows users to upload images for real-time disease recognition. It supports farmers by enabling early detection, reducing the spread of infections, and minimizing crop losses. My contribution involved preparing the problem statement and designing the system architecture, including UML and block diagrams, which formed the foundation for the model integration and application flow. This solution offers a cost-effective, user-friendly tool to promote sustainable agriculture and food security.</p>
